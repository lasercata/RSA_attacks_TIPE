# RSA_attacks
RSA implementation and attacks

This repository contains the *code*, the *presentation documents* as well as some *other documents* (draft, cheatsheet, ressources) for my TIPE, presented the year 2022 / 2023.
The theme was: *la ville* (*the city*).

The TIPE (Travaux d'Initiative Personnelle Encadr√©s) is a project realised during two years, in French scientific preparatory schools, and presented during the competitive examinations.

## Presentation documents
The presentation slides are in the folder `Presentation/Slides/`: [`TIPE_Presentation.pdf`](Presentation/Slides/TIPE_Presentation.pdf).

The bibliography is in `MCOT/`: [`Mcot.pdf`](MCOT/Mcot.pdf)

## Code
### Run
To run the code (testing all the attacks):
```
python3 main.py
```

And to change the RSA key size used for the tests (default is 2048):
```
python3 main.py [size]
```

### Structure
The main file is `main.py`.
It uses other files from `modules/`.

More details about the code in the file [`RSA_attacks_TIPE__listings.pdf`](Presentation/Listings/RSA_attacks_TIPE__listings.pdf).
